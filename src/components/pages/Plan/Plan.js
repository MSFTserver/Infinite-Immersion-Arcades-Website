                  Infinite Immersion Arcades' multi-experience VR arcade will
                  cater to the growing demand for virtual reality entertainment
                  that includes people across multiple facets outside gaming
                  culture, including educational tools for schools and
                  businesses. It will feature VR free-roam arenas provided by
                  EVA, allowing up to 10 players to participate in the After-H
                  battle arena game or with up to 8 players in one of the two
                  other games they offer, After-H zombies and After-H Legend of
                  Mars. We chose EVA as they provide the largest free-roam
                  venues at 5600 square feet. Arenas with HTC Vive Focus 3
                  headsets and VR-ready HP Omen desktops with the latest
                  hardware also allow wireless play with the new wifi
                  capabilities. This new technology helps our focus to eliminate
                  backpacks and wires that can add restrictions to users and
                  draw away from the immersive experience. We would also look at
                  other companies to partner with, including ZerolatencyVR. They
                  will provide a few more exclusive titles, such as FarCry, and
                  six more games that work in a free-roam environment with up to
                  8 players. Another free-roam company we are considering is
                  Varena. They have seven games to choose from, customizable map
                  sizes for various setups like Number of rounds, round
                  duration, number of simultaneous players, and more. The arcade
                  will also have briefing rooms to introduce the players to the
                  free-roam experiences and get suited up for the game while
                  providing an area for pre-event strategizing against
                  opponents. EVA also provides a large viewing room for
                  spectators to watch the games live streaming inside the arenas
                  and keep up with all the esports action.

                  The establishment will also include private, medium, large,
                  and Party rooms to accommodate various group sizes and
                  preferences for VR gaming. Each person has roughly 7 feet of
                  space in rooms with multiple stations to move around inside,
                  except in some cases with escape room games requiring players
                  in closer proximity. Medium rooms and Large rooms will feature
                  couches to accommodate friends and family. The party room will
                  feature the ability to stream from reserved rooms for
                  partygoers taking a break to keep in on the action. It will
                  also include tables and chairs for all their presents and
                  cake. Initially, these rooms will be run off of SpringboardVR
                  for the wide variety and quality of games. Including genres
                  like PvP FPS, fantasy, sci-fi, and horror, with over 400 games
                  in the collection. They also have nice inbuilt features for
                  gauging time played per title and pricing for usage. The
                  medium rooms will also feature VR Escape Room games provided
                  by VRcave to give users even more immersive experiences and
                  streamline booking full rooms faster, as these types of
                  experiences usually require a group of 2-5 players. They
                  include seven escape games and one puzzle arcade game.

                  The center will also host a variety of turn-key attractions
                  that will add to the unique experiences offered. We would
                  include solutions such as VirtuixOmni arenas featuring the
                  unique Omni 2.0 motion technology that allows players to roam
                  freely without boundaries using their unique treadmill system.
                  They also feature a $100,000 prize pool in ongoing weekly and
                  monthly esports contests which will drive repeated customers.
                  We will also feature the Hyperdeck from MajorMega, with a
                  full-motion floor allowing players to pitch, roll and rumble
                  for an immersive experience without motion sickness. Thanks to
                  multi-sensory effects and heat and hurricane simulations,
                  visitors feel truly part of the action. Spectators can also
                  join in, dropping perks to help players or triggering
                  explosions to increase the challenge. While guests have some
                  time to spare waiting around for their next session, they can
                  hop into a short 5-10 minute game in the Hologate arena by
                  themselves or with up to 3 other friends for a multiplayer
                  experience. With the Hologate Arena, players are transported
                  into the immersive virtual reality world, where they will
                  fight robots, zombies, and dragons or even challenge each
                  other in heart-pounding virtual dance battles.

                  Apart from all these venues and attractions, we would also
                  like to provide an area for new, upcoming, or established VR
                  companies. This model will be highly attractive as we will be

                  attracting the most extensive customer base in the VR market
                  and would be part of a revenue-sharing agreement that allows
                  them to showcase experiences to a large audience. The deal
                  would have the company own and facilitate the construction of
                  their venue while we operate it, allowing their product to be
                  seen by thousands of people every month, gaining a wider
